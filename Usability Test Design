Usability Testing for MunchiMaps
Introduction
The objective of this formative usability test is to assess how user-friendly the current design 
of the MunchiMaps platform is and how efficiently users can interact with the main UI features. 
Since the user group includes people looking for vending machines or food and drink options,
the test will focus on how smoothly they can navigate, locate vending machines, and use the review and rating system. 
The test will include 3 participants, which should help identify around 60% of usability issues.

Participant Screening
Q1: On a scale of 1-10, how comfortable are you navigating online maps or location-based apps?
Note: Disqualify participants who score below 5.
Q2: Share your experience with using apps or websites to locate vending machines or specific locations (e.g., Google Maps, vending locators).
Note: Participants without related experience are disqualified.
Q3: On a scale of 1-10, how often do you explore different tools or apps to locate food or drink options efficiently?
Note: Disqualify participants who score below 5.
Q4: On a scale of 1-10, what is your level of satisfaction with your current method of finding vending machines or quick food options?
Note: Participants who score 8 or higher are disqualified, as they may not need a new service like MunchiMaps.

Scenarios
Scenario 1: Interacting with Vending Machine Icons Participants will engage with the MunchiMaps interface as first-time users, 
tasked with navigating the map to locate a vending machine of interest. They will review the available information about 
vending machine locations, including service status,  options (e.g., snacks, drinks). During the process, participants will 
be encouraged to speak aloud about their thoughts and actions.

Instructions:
Open the MunchiMaps website and locate a nearby vending machine.
Click on an icon to view its details.
Evaluate the vending machine based on its description (service status, payment options, etc.).
Use the review section to submit feedback on the vending machine.
Rate the machine from 1 to 5 stars and leave a comment using the review form.

Scenario 2: Submitting a Review and Rating In this scenario, participants will be taken to a vending machine’s 
review page. They will be tasked with providing feedback on the vending machine, using the review system to rate and comment. 
The usability of the form submission and the language filter (if inappropriate words are detected) will be tested.
Instructions:
Open a vending machine’s info window and navigate to the review section.
Submit a rating using the star system.
Write a review (including an attempt to enter inappropriate words to test the language filter).
Observe any error messages or issues while submitting the review.
After submitting, check if the review appears correctly.


Feedback Method
During the usability tests, participants will be closely observed while they interact with the MunchiMaps platform,
including navigating the vending machine icons, reading machine descriptions, submitting reviews, and using the rating system.
This observation will cover their comments, actions, and any difficulties they face.
After completing the tasks, participants will answer a series of post-test questions to assess their overall experience. 
Participants will rate each statement on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being strongly disagree and 10 being strongly agree.

"The vending machine descriptions were clear and helpful."
"I had no issues submitting a review and rating."

"I was able to quickly understand how to use the star rating and review system."
"I think most people would be able to use MunchiMaps without difficulty."
